    <h1><i>LIVING A LIFE OF TESTIMONIES</i></h1>
                     <b>CHAPTER ONE</b>:Regretful Journey
      <p>Growing up, full of uncertainity in my life made me to do many unwarranted things.Spirit of unsatisfaction!
        I didn't know where my life was heading to.Was I disable in a way or what was 
        He planning for me all these years of disappointment and failure ?All I knew that I wasliving and fullfiling
        the Christ's obligations and rules in my Christian life.Having been saved at a early age, I knew I had
        a brighter future full of hopes.I had to struggle and find my way out to succeed in my life since that's
        all I wanted.</p>

        
    
      <p>Being born in a family that I had all along thought was well off made me to be more reluxed.<em>God, my father 
        is the source of all richies both in heaven and on earth</em> .I had akways console myself with the qoute which had
        often listen from most of the evangelical service I had attended with my fellow youths.Disappointment grew day
        and night and was realy not aware of what I was doing wrong.All these made me to look back into my life .Was it 
         ancestrally controlled or it was the spirit of my late biological father which was in control?It got worse on me day 
         and night. Was I conceive to live a life full agony and gnashing of teeth?Disappointments  grew one after the other.
         Questioning God became part of my lifestyle.Was I right?</p>

      <p>Jakes had been my name,born on 3rd October 2006. Was it because of the odd number on my birthday?It made me to have 
        the ordasity to abandone christianity since all doors seemed to be closed.Financially,academically,socially,spiritually 
        and emotionally ,all closed.
      </p>
